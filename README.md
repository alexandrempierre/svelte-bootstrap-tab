# svelte-bootstrap-tab

This is a basic implementation of Bootstrap tabs as Svelte components. I wrote this because even though sveltestrap is great it made really difficult for me to style the nav-tabs and tab-content independently. Maybe the problem is how sveltestrap is documented or I didn't read enough of Bootstrap documentation. Maybe the problem was me. Either way my solution was to make my own component.

For more information on how to run this you can go to:

* [Bootstrap 5 docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)
* [Svelte Template repo](https://github.com/sveltejs/template) (really useful since this is a clone of a svelte template with some other things)
* [Svelte Docs](https://svelte.dev/docs)
